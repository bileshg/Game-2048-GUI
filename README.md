# 2048 Game using Pygame

This project is a Python-based implementation of the famous 2048 game, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Pygame.

## Description

The game follows the same rules as the original 2048 game, where the player must slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. However, this implementation of the game does not have a winning condition, and the player can continue playing even after reaching the 2048 tile. The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Pygame, allowing the player to interact with the game using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame
- Pip for package management

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bileshg/Game-2048-GUI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Game-2048-GUI
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Executing program

- Run the game using Python:
  ```bash
  python main.py

## Playing the Game

- Use the arrow keys or the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys to slide the tiles in the desired direction.
- Combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with a higher number.
- The game ends when there are no more possible moves.
